# Software

General scripts and software for everyday computational chemistry. Folder names are designed to be self explanatory but just in case we have:

**build** - contains functions to build stuff

**run** - contains functions to help with runtime

**analyse** - contains functions for post-processing

**examples** - example usage, for quality assurance tests and user guidance

Insert this folder directory into your systems PYTHONPATH variable (e.g. ~/.bashrc) and it should automatically pick up the functions in the child folders. 

*Example: export PYTHONPATH:$PWD:$PYTHONPATH*
