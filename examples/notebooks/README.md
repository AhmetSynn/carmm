This is folder with Jupyter notebooks explaining how to use internal and external packages.

If you want to play with the notebooks, run on your local computer with `jupyter notebook` and then selecting the notebook of interest 

(*Note: you might need to install jupyter first with `pip install --user jupyter`*)

Alternatively, clicking on the binder link above will take you to a web platform where you can play with the notebooks without installing anything!
