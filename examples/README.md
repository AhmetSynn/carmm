# QA Tests and Examples

This folder contains all QA tests, which are also examples of how to use the functions.

When adding a QA test:
- If adding a function to an existing module, please place the QA test in the corresponding module file here (if it's a new module, create a file!)
- Make sure the QA test addresses as much of the code as possible
- Include an `assert` test so that if someone changes the code, we can make sure it still works

When looking to use functionality yourself:
- Get rid of functions you don't need from any file!
- Remove the `assert` test and use the outputs to your needs!
